## General Coding Guidelines

### Error Handling
- **Avoid try/catch blocks unless absolutely necessary**
store operations that could fail due to external factors
- Do NOT use try/catch for:
  - Simple function calls that should work if inputs are valid
  - Basic string/data manipulation
  - Internal function calls within the same codebase
- Prefer early returns and validation over catching exceptions
- Use explicit error checking when possible (e.g., `if not file_exists()` instead of catching FileNotFoundError)
